On sldies:

P11: reqrite "break not detected", should use if no break...

P16: delete theorem 1

P16: should use "not optimal", not "incorrect". Add no break case in the Monte Carlo and explain why SIC is getting worse.

Use THICKER lines for graph so it looks better when projected.

Monte Carlo Great Moderation Design:

	- add details on how to estimate the break model
	- understand what causes those differences

Add all stuff I wrote on the whiteboard to my slides: needs more info for non-econometricians

Add a simple example.

Add review of terms, such as, OOS, etc.
