On sldies:

P11: reqrite "break not detected", should use if no break...

P16: delete theorem 1

P16: should use "not optimal", not "incorrect". Add no break case in the Monte Carlo and explain why SIC is getting worse.

Use THICKER lines for graph so it looks better when projected.

Monte Carlo Great Moderation Design:

	- add details on how to estimate the break model
	- understand what causes those differences

Add all stuff I wrote on the whiteboard to my slides: needs more info for non-econometricians

Add a simple example.

Add review of terms, such as, OOS, etc.


May 13, 2014:

- be clear on how to calculate weights

- provide a section "implementation" before theory giving more details on those weights (cookbook)

- call Mallows' weights Hansen's weights

- try more models to see your statistic

- differentiate population weight and sample weight

- show sample weight converges to population weight

- make introduction shorter

- can remove literature review

- define formally what "optimality" is

- rewrite theorem 3.4

- explain why and how information criterion matetrs for weighting

- can delete tha table of information criteria

- move lemma 3.1 to the definition of cross-validation

- give a footnote on what "weak convergence" is

- no worry for partial breaks

- think about if you can make "delta" a vector

- delete footbote 11

- on theorem 3.2, be specific on what "equivalent" means

- capitalize "Assumption 1"

- just mention "it is a function of brownian bridge", delete "nonstandard"

- be consistent on the notation of "e" tilda

- be precise on theorem 3.4 resutls

- put citation at the end of a sentence (after punctuation), no space needed

- in proof, you used convergence in probability, not continous mapping theorem

- in proof, you cite one theorem or lemma, not ciing an entire book chapter

- delete those comments in your proof, they do not belong there
